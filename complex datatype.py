#
# here 'a' is the real part and 'b'is the imaginary part
#In real part you can store decimal,binary,octal,etc..but in imaginaary part you can store only decimal
# if you store in imaginary part then it give error.so-

#FOR REAL PART
# c=0b1111+10j
# print(c)

# c_1=0o124+11j
# print(c_1)

#FOR IMAGINARY PART

# c=15+0b111 j
# print(c)

# if you want see only the real part or only the imaginary part then

# a=10+4j
# print( int(a.real))
# print(int(a.imag))
# if u want to see real or imaginary part value in integer datatype the u used int inside the print function

# you must use 'j' in ur imaginary part .You can't use any other component then u get error

# c=10+5k
# prin(c)

# you can also use 'j' in both real part and in imaginary part then  it add trhe two real and imaginary part

# c=10j+55j
# print(c)
